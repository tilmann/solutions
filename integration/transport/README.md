# Open Questions

## TAM

Is the TAM a function of the scenario? --> Example telepresence

## How to model the prioritization of the solutions in the integration scenario

--> Transportation Integration Process - Figure 3

## Do we need to address this: (Phase 2)

So if a single model uses a new TAM source, this changes the TAM numbers and should be replicated across all solutions using that TAM and the Integration Model file.
